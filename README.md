  ## Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Heri

Full-stack developer focused on building real products, not tutorial graveyards.

I enjoy turning messy ideas into clean, scalable systems — from frontend UX to backend logic. I’m especially interested in product-driven development, learning by building, and solving real-world problems with code.

🧠 How I Think as a Developer

Clarity > cleverness

Simple first, scalable later

If I don’t understand it, I break it down until I do

Code is a tool — problem-solving is the skill
